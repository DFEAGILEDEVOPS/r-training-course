# Data

We're going to use data from [the Department for Education's School Workforce Census](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/school-workforce-in-england-november-2016). This is an annual census of teachers in England that's collected every November and published in the following July.

We'll use two CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files that contain simplified versions of the original data. One has data on headcounts and the other has data for hours worked (full-time equivalent, or FTE). You'll download these to your Project folder, which you set up in the previous chapter.

2. Save the file to the 'Data' subfolder of your Project folder
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for [the hours worked (FTE) data](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/r-training-course/tree/master/data/swfc_2016_fte.csv)
