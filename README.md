## R Training Course [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfe-analytical-services/r-training-course.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfe-analytical-services/r-training-course)

This is a training course developed by Callum Staff as an introductory course to R.

It has 12 chapters:

* Getting set up
* The data used in the course
* General coding practice
* Loading in and exploring data
* Manipulating dataframes
* dplyr
* Graphs
* Iteration
* Statistical operations
* Functions
* Maps
* R Markdown

It is written in R Markdown, with an HTML output, however it has a separate R script (training_code.R) which contains all of the code in the R Markdown file, allowing the tutor to run the code they are talking through.
