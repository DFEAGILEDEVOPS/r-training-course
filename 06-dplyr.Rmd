# Data manipulation with **`dplyr`**

## Packages

One of the great things about R (and lots of other open source programming languages) is that you can add in extra functionality really easy. These extra functions come in the form of packages.

To get a package, we first need to install it. This can be done in the console, as once installed, we don't need to reinstall every time we start a new session of R.

We are going to install a package called <span class="code">dplyr</span>, a package to manipulate data.

```{r sec5_1.1,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

A lot of funny stuff will come up in your Console, ignore it, it's all normal (or should be!).

Once we've installed it, we have to load the package. This we do have to do every time we start a new session of R.

```{r sec5_1.2,eval=FALSE}
#Load required library
library(dplyr)
```

## The pipe

The first feature we'll look at is the pipe: <span class="code">%>%</span>. We take our data and then we pass it through the pipe, which in effect means the word 'then'. We'll then analyse our data in some way using one of the functions that comes from the `dplyr` package. This in effect looks like: 

<img src="www/R_dplyr_pipe.png" width="1000"></img>

The way around the arrow goes doesn't matter, it can be either way, so the below code...

```{r sec5_2.1,eval=FALSE}
output_dataframe <- swfc_16 %>%
  select(LA_Name)
```

...is equivalent to this code. For the purposes of consistency in this tutorial, we will be using the above style. 

```{r sec5_2.2,eval=FALSE}
swfc_16 %>%
  select(LA_Name) -> output_dataframe
```

<div class="tip"><b>Tip:</b>

You can shortcut to a pipe by CTRL + SHIFT + M. 
</div>

## Selecting columns 

We may only be interested in a few of the variables in our dataframe. For example, in the `swfc_16` file, we have 59 variables, but we may be only interested in 2 of those for our analysis. We can use the `select` function from the `dplyr` package (once this is installed and loaded) to choose those.  

**Select two columns from `swfc_16` dataframe**

Here we'll take two variables `LA_Number` and `LA_Name` and store them in a new dataframe I've named `selected_variables_ex_1`. 

```{r sec5_3.1,eval=FALSE}
#Select only LA_Number and LA_Name column
selected_variables_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>% 
  select(LA_Number, LA_Name)
```

**Select all columns bar the LA_Number and LA_Name columns using the minus sign**

```{r sec5_3.2,eval=FALSE}
#Take all columns bar the LA_Number and LA_Name column
selected_variables_ex_2 <- swfc_16 %>% 
  select(-LA_Number, -LA_Name) 
```

**Selecting all columns that start with the word LA**

```{r sec5_3.3,eval=FALSE}
#Take all columns that start with LA
selected_variables_ex_3 <- swfc_16 %>% 
  select(starts_with("LA"))
```

<div class="activity"><b>Activity A6.3:</b>

1. Select the columns `School_Name` and `School_Type` and assign them to a dataframe. 
2. Select the first three columns. Tip: use `1:3` inside the select function. 

Hint: Write each step of code, run it, check it works, and then add the next recipe step in.
</div>

## Renaming columns

We can rename columns with the dplyr `rename` function. Inside the fucntion, we'll have two parts. We'll have the name we'd like our column to be set equal to the name of the column we currently have. 

E.g. if we'd like to change the column name in `swfc_16` from `LA_Name` to `local_authority`, we'd run:

```{r sec5_4.1, eval=FALSE}
#Rename the LA_Name column to be local_authority
renamed_data_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
  rename(local_authority = LA_Name)
```

## Filtering data

If we only want specific data where a contain is met, we can use the dplyr `filter` function in our pipe. 

To filter on things that are characters or factors, e.g. School Type's that are Free Schools, we'd wrap them within speech marks such as "Free Schools". For filtering on numeric values, we don't need to do this. 

```{r sec5_5.1, eval=FALSE}
#Select all free schools in the dataset only
filtered_data_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
  filter(School_Type == "Free Schools") 
```

**Note:** here we used an == symbol. This evaluates the data to find School Type's where they are equal to "Free Schools

```{r sec5_5.2, eval=FALSE}
#Select schools where more than half of teachers are male
filtered_data_ex_2 <- swfc_16 %>%
  filter(Perc_Male_Teachers > 50)
```

To filter on multiple contiditions, we can use the `&` (and) and `|` (or) symbols. 

```{r sec5_5.3, eval=FALSE}
#Select the data for free schools or special schools in the dataset only
filtered_data_ex_3 <- swfc_16 %>%
  filter(School_Type %in% "Free Schools" | School_Type == "Special schools")
```

**Question: What would happen if you ask to find schools that are Free Schools and are also Special Schools?**

```{r sec5_5.4, eval=FALSE}
#Select the data for schools that are free schools and special schools at the same time 
filtered_data_ex_3 <- swfc_16 %>%
  filter(School_Type == "Free Schools" & School_Type == "Special schools")
```

<div class="activity"><b>Activity A6.2:</b> 

1. Filter where `LA_Name` is "Wigan" and `Tot_Days_Sickness_Absence` is greater than 50. 
2. Use <span class="code">!is.na()</span> to filter out all schools without a value for the percentage of teachers who are qualified. Explain what <span class="code">!is.na()</span> does.
</div>

## Arranging data

To order data from low to high by a column, we can use the dplyr `arrange` function. It by default arranges columns from low to high, e.g:

```{r sec5_6.1, eval=FALSE}
#Arrange data by total workforce from low to high
arranged_data_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
  arrange(Tot_Workforce_HC)
```

But wrapping the column around the `desc` function which stands for descending order, we can order from high to low, e.g: 

```{r sec5_6.2, eval=FALSE}
#Arrange data by total workforce from high to low
arranged_data_ex_2 <- swfc_16 %>%
  arrange(desc(Tot_Workforce_HC)
```

## Generating new columns

When we make new columns in dplyr, we use the `mutate` function. We have two columns in the data, one that's called `StatutoryHighAge` and another called `StatutoryLowAge`. These are the highest and lowest ages of pupils in a school. We can find the range of the ages of pupils in each school by running:

```{r sec5_7.1, eval=FALSE}
#Select the data for schools that are free schools and special schools at the same time 
added_column_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
  mutate(age_range_school = StatutoryHighAge - StatutoryLowAge)
```

Note that the dataframe `added_column_ex_1` now has 60 columns and we can check that this column makes sense by just looking at the following columns

```{r sec5_7.2, eval=FALSE}
#Check the new column makes sense by visually checking 
added_column_ex_1 %>%
  select(StatutoryLowAge, StatutoryHighAge, age_range_school)
```

## Changing variable classes

From chapter 4, we discussed the different variable classes, such as characters and factors. We can use the `mutate` function to do this for us. 

For example, if we'd like to change the `School_Name` column from being a factor to a character, we can run:

```{r sec5_8.1, eval=FALSE}
#Check the new column makes sense by visually checking 
variable_class_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
  mutate(School_Name = as.character(School_Name))
```

## Recoding values in a column 

In a column, we may have values that we'd like to change. E.g. within the School Type column we have possible values such as `Academies` and `LA maintained schools`. We may want to change `Academies` to be `Academy schools` and we can do that with a combination of the `mutate` function and the `recode` function. 

```{r sec5_9.1, eval=FALSE}
#Check the new column makes sense by visually checking 
recoded_ex_1 <- swfc_16 %>%
     mutate(School_Type = recode(School_Type, Academies = "Academy schools"))
```

## Joining data together

There are a number of types of joins that <span class="code">dplyr</span> offers. We won't go through them here as this isn't what this course is about, but [this post](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/227171_618ebdce0b9d44f3af65700e833593db.html) goes through them clearly. We will use a left join - keeping all rows on one dataframe, joining another on a certain variable where they match, and making all rows which don't match 'not applicable'.

We will create a dataframe which details whether a Government Office Region is in London or the Rest of England and then match it to the rest of the School Workforce Census. Just copy and paste the code below to make a lookup dataframe. 

```{r sec5_10.1,eval=FALSE}
#Create dataframe on whether region is in London or Rest of England
ldn_roe <- data.frame(Government_Office_Region_Name = c("East Midlands", "East of England", 
                                                        "Inner London", "North East", 
                                                        "North West", "Outer London", 
                                                        "South East", "South West", 
                                                        "West Midlands", "Yorkshire and the Humber"),
                      ldn_roe = c("RoE","RoE","LDN","RoE","RoE","LDN","RoE","RoE","RoE","RoE"))
```

Now we have this lookup dataframe called `ldn_roe` we can now left join this onto our `swfc_16` dataframe by the common identifier between the two datasets called `Government_Office_Region_Name`.

```{r, sec5_10.2, eval=FALSE}
#Match to SWFC
swfc_16 <- left_join(swfc_16,LDN_RoE,by="Government_Office_Region_Name")
```

**Note: We can also match on column names even if they columns are named differently.**

## Pivoting data

Pivoting (grouping data by certain characteristics and then performing certain calculations - counts of each group or averages for each group) is a really popular feature in Excel, and can be replicated using <span class="code">dplyr</span>.

We're going to create two pivot tables:

* Count the number of each type of school
* Calculate the average % of teachers with Qualified Teacher Status for each school type

The image below shows the boxes from the Excel pivot table user interface with the entries to build the pivot table for the first of the list above.

<img src="www/Excel_Pivot.png" width="300"></img>

```{r sec5_11.1, eval=FALSE}
#Calculate the number of schools by school type
school_type_count <- swfc_16 %>% #Set the name of the output object and feed in 'the ingredients' - swfc_16 in this instance
  group_by(School_Type) %>% #Recipe step 1: Specifying the variable we want to group the data by
  summarise(Count_Schools = n()) #Recipe step 2: Define what function we want to apply to the grouped data. Here we are doing a simple count - n(). We also specify the name of the new column, in this instance 'Count_Schools'
```

<div class="tip"><b>Tip:</b>

To prevent your lines of code being too long you can start new lines after things like <span class="code">%>%</span>, <span class="code">,</span>, <span class="code">=</span>, and <span class="code"><-</span>.

If you go to 'Tools', 'Global Options', 'Code', 'Display' there is an option called 'Show margin' which adds a margin after 80 characters as a default - try not to exceed this.
</div>

```{r sec5_11.2,eval=FALSE}
#Calculate average percentage of qualified teachers per school, grouped by school type
av_qts_schooltype <- swfc_16 %>% #Set the name of the output object and feed in 'the ingredients' - swfc_16 in this instance
  group_by(School_Type) %>% #Recipe step 1: Specifying the variable we want to group the data by
  summarise(Ave_Perc_QTS = mean(Perc_QTS_Teachers,na.rm=TRUE))
    #Recipe step 2: Calculate the average percentage of qualified teachers for each group. The 'na.rm=TRUE' argument does not consider rows where the value is NA.
```

<div class="activity"><b>Activity A6.1:</b> Calculate the total number of full time posts which are vacant, by Government Office Region, using the function <span class="code">sum(column,na.rm=TRUE)</span>. Remember to turn the full time posts column into a data type which can be summed.</div>

## More advanced exercises 

As we learned earlier, the `mutate` function allows you to alter data in the dataframe, as we did a few sections ago. Let's take the code above where we calculated the number of schools of each type of school, bolt on some more recipe steps, and calculate the percentage of schools in each group.

```{r sec5_12.1,eval=FALSE}
#Calculate the percentage of schools by school type
school_type_count <- swfc_16 %>%
  group_by(School_Type) %>%
  summarise(Count_Schools = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Perc_Schools = Count_Schools/sum(Count_Schools))
```

Let's break this down:

1. We've used the mutate function
2. We've created a new column called <span class="code">Perc_Schools</span>
3. <span class="code">Perc_Schools</span> equals the count for each school type, divided by the total number of schools, calculated using <span class="code">sum()</span>

We can also mutate a column without creating a new column:

```{r sec5_12.2,eval=FALSE}
#Calculate the percentage of schools by school type
school_type_count <- swfc_16 %>%
  group_by(School_Type) %>%
  summarise(Count_Schools = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Perc_Schools = Count_Schools/sum(Count_Schools)) %>% 
  mutate(Perc_Schools = round(Perc_Schools*100,1)) #Multiply Perc_Schools by 100 to get a percentage, and round to 1 decimal place.
```

<div class="activity"><b>Activity A6.3:</b> The big one - use <span class="code">dplyr</span> to find out what percentage of secondary school (not including all through school) teaching assistants the East of England has. These are the functions you'll need to run:

1. A filter
2. Pivoting using a sum
3. Mutating
4. Filtering on 'East of England'
5. Selecting the value column
6. Using <span class="code">as.numeric()</span> to return just one number

Hint: Write each step of code, run it, check it works, and then add the next recipe step in.
